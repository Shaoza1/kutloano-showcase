RE: APPLICATION FOR SPECIALIST: FINANCIAL SYSTEMS (M-PESA) POSITION

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Specialist: Financial Systems (M-Pesa) position at Vodacom Lesotho. As a BSc Computing graduate with hands-on experience in financial systems, API integrations, and enterprise system administration, I am excited to contribute to Vodacom's M-Pesa platform success in Lesotho.

ALIGNMENT WITH ROLE REQUIREMENTS

My background directly aligns with your key requirements:

**Financial Systems Experience**: Through my production applications, I have developed and maintained financial transaction systems, including payment gateway integrations and SMS-based payment processing (WASMS API) in my AgroSense platform, which advanced to UNDP AI Hackathon finals.

**System Administration & Integration**: My NetWatch Pro enterprise platform demonstrates my ability to administer complex systems, develop technical requirements, and manage system integrations. The platform includes real-time monitoring, capacity management, and comprehensive technical architecture documentation.

**Database & Server Environments**: I have extensive experience with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and cloud server environments (AWS, Supabase), managing transaction data, user authentication, and system performance optimization across multiple production applications.

**IT Service Management**: My AWS IoT internship at Sokul Automation provided hands-on experience in system maintenance, technical requirement analysis, and stakeholder collaboration - directly applicable to M-Pesa system administration.

TECHNICAL CONTRIBUTIONS I CAN MAKE

**Technical Requirements & Feasibility Analysis**: My experience developing TRPs (Technical Requirement Proposals) and conducting feasibility assessments for multiple production systems positions me well to evaluate M-Pesa system enhancements for impact, cost, and integration complexity.

**System Architecture & Documentation**: I have created comprehensive technical and logical architecture documentation for enterprise systems, maintained system inventories, and developed capacity management plans - essential skills for M-Pesa system administration.

**Stakeholder Engagement**: Through my projects and internship experience, I have facilitated technical discussions with diverse stakeholders, ensuring clear communication of technical developments and gaining buy-in for system transitions.

**Mobile Money Understanding**: My work with payment APIs, SMS integration, and financial transaction processing provides relevant mobile money platform knowledge that I can immediately apply to M-Pesa systems.

My combination of technical expertise, local market understanding, and proven ability to deliver production-ready financial systems makes me well-positioned to support M-Pesa's continued growth and reliability.
